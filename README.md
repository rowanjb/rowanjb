Hello :)
- I'm a PhD student from Canada now based in Munich
- My primary scientific interest is polar oceanography, and especially ocean convection ([which is Henry Stommel-certified cool](https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.48.5.766))
- I also enjoy the tech side of climate modelling, i.e., numerics, HPCs, Linux, Python, Fortran, etc etc
- You can check out my webpage [here](https://rowanjb.github.io)
